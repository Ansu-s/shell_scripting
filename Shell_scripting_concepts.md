# <p align = center > Shell Scripting Concepts </p>

### Shell :
#### <p> The shell is a command-line interface that interprets and executes commands. Common Unix-like shells include Bash,C shell,Zsh, and PowerShell on Windows. <p>
### Commands : 
#### The  commands include cd,pwd,ls,mkdir,rmdir,touch,cat,rm,head,tail,find,kill etc
### Shell Environment:
#### This includes variables, environment variables, and configuration files like .bashrc or .bash_profile, is crucial. These elements affect how your shell scripts behave.
### Input and Output: 
#### Handling standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout), and standard error (stderr). Redirecting, piping, and capturing output from commands are important techniques.
### Conditions and loops:
#### conditional constructs like if, elif, and else to make decisions and control the flow of your script based on conditions.Employing loops such as for and while to perform repetitive tasks, iterate over lists, or process data until certain conditions are met.
### Command-Line Arguments: 
#### Handling command-line arguments passed to scripts using $1, $2, and so on, as well as the special variables like $# and $@.
### Error Handling: 
#### Implementing error trapping, checking exit codes, and logging errors to make scripts more robust.
### Pipes and Filters: 
#### Using pipes (|) to connect commands and filters like grep, sed, and awk to process and transform data streams.
### Exit Codes and Interactive Scripts: 
#### Handling exit codes and using them to determine the success or failure of commands and scripts.Creating scripts that provide interactive command-line interfaces to users, prompting for input and guiding them through tasks.
