### Change directory to a specified path :
cd /path/to/directoryName

### Print the current working directory :
pwd

### List the contents of the current directory :
ls

### Create a new directory :
mkdir new_directory

### Remove a directory (only if it's empty) :
rmdir directory_name

### Create an empty file :
touch fileName.txt

### View the contents of a file :
cat fileName.txt

### To tell the compiler to use bash shell:
#!(It is called a shebang mostly treated as a comment by the interpreter) then the location of the compiler /bin/bash

### Declare and use a simple variable :
    name="Ansu"
    echo "Hello, $name!"

### Create and use environment variables :
Environment variables are the Variables that are exported to all processes spawned by the shell. Their settings can be seen with the env command. A subset of environment variables, such as PATH, affects the behavior of the shell itself. Shell (local) variables â€“ Variables that affect only the current shell.

    export MY_VARIABLE="This is an environment variable"
    echo "Environment Variable: $MY_VARIABLE"

### Define a function that uses a parameter :
    show() {
    local greeting="Hello"
    local person_name="Ansu"
    echo "$greeting, $person_name!"
    }

### Call the function with a parameter :
    greet "Ansu"

### Accessing environment variables :
    echo "Home Directory: $HOME"
    echo "User: $USER"

### Using configuration files like .bashrc or .bash_profile :
    echo "Contents of .bashrc:"
    cat ~/.bashrc
    echo "Contents of .bash_profile:"
    cat ~/.bash_profile

## Shell program to demonstrate the input and showing output process :
 
```#!/bin/bash

 echo "Enter your name:"
 read name

echo "Hello, $name!"

echo "Enter a number:"
read num1

echo "Enter the second number:"
read num2

sum=$((num1 + num2))
echo "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is: $sum"

echo "Enter the name of a file:"
read filename

if [ -e "$filename" ]; then
echo "Contents of $filename:"
cat "$filename"
else
echo "File not found: $filename"
fi

echo "This is inserted if the above statement is true using the fi command." > output.txt
echo "Contents have been written to output.txt"
```
## Shell program to demonstrate the condition statements :

```#!/bin/bash

age=25

if [ "$age" -ge 18 ]; then
echo "You are an adult."
else
echo "You are a minor."
fi
 ``` 
## Switch Cases :
````
#!/bin/bash
echo "Choose an option:"
echo "1. Add A"
echo "2. Multiplication B"
echo "3. Division C"
read choice

case $choice in
1)
    echo "You have chosen Option A."
    ;;
2)
    echo "You have chosen Option B."
    ;;
3)
    echo "You have chosen Option C."
    ;;
*)
echo "Invalid choice. Please select a valid option."
;;
esac
````
## Error Handling in Shell :

### Function to handle errors and log them to a file :

    handle_error() {
    local error_message="$1"
    local timestamp=$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
    echo "[$timestamp] ERROR: $error_message" >> error.log
    exit 1
    }

### Trap errors and call the handle_error function :
    trap 'handle_error "An error occurred while running the script"' ERR

### Simulate an error by trying to remove a non-existent file :
    rm non_existent_file.txt

### Check the exit status of the previous command :
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    handle_error "Failed to remove the file."
    else
    echo "File removed successfully."
    fi

### Another example: dividing by zero :
    echo "Let's divide 10 by 0 and handle the error."
    result=$(echo "scale=2; 10 / 0" | bc 2>&1)

    if [[ "$result" == *"divide by zero"* ]]; then
    handle_error "Division by zero."
    else
    echo "Result: $result"
    fi       

### If no errors occurred, log a success message :
    echo "Script completed successfully." >> error.log

### Pipe and filter :

```` #!/bin/bash
echo "Fruit Data:"
echo "Apple
Banana
Cherry
Date
Elderberry
Fig" > fruits.txt

echo "Original Data:"
cat fruits.txt

echo "Filtering lines containing 'Banana' or 'Cherry':"
cat fruits.txt | grep -E 'Banana|Cherry'

rm fruits.txt
````
### Fail and exit :

```#!/bin/bash
echo "Checking for a network connection..."

ping -c 3 google.com > /dev/null 2>&1

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
echo "Error: Unable to establish a network connection."
exit 1
fi

echo "Success: A network connection is available."
```
### Template Resolution :

Here we hava a template file where we can replace the different elements with data.
The below is the template.txt file.

    Hello, {{name}}!
    Today is {{day}}.
If we want to replace the data in above template file we use the below code.

```#!/bin/bash
day=$(date +%A)
template=$(cat template.txt)
template=${template//\{\{name\}\}/Ansu} 
template=${template//\{\{day\}\}/$day}  

echo "$template" > resolved_template.txt
echo "Template resolved and saved to resolved_template.txt"
```
### GREP , SED and AWK :

Grep is Global Regular Expression Print it searches for a patter in the given file and how the results in a highlighted manner. 
SED is a powerful text editor which is used to perform basic transformations on the stream of input text.
 some common sed commands are  "/old_text/new_text/g","/pattern/d","=","/pattern/p" etc.
Awk is a text editor it is very versatile it is used to manipulate the data present in different fields. We can also make custom functions as per aou necessity.

     
    grep "patten" file_name.txt
    grep "hello" myfile.txt
    
    sed "=" myfile.txt
    sed "/this/d" mytext.txt"
    
    awk '{print $1}' data.txt
    awk 'function double(x) { return x * 2 } {print double($3)}' mydata.txt

### Processes in Linux :
To list all the processes running in the bash shell we use "ps aux" command. top,htop,pstree,ps axjf
to get the names of the process we can filter the process by providing a flag to the ps command.
The pgrep command is designed specifically for finding process IDs by name.
ps command to list running processes and then use grep to search for a specific process by name.
pgrep is used to find the process ID by it name.

To find the port numbers of a process we can use he ss , netstat or lsof (the listening states) command these will get the port number based on either of their proces name or ID

To kill a process we use the kill command. -9 flag is used along with the kill command to kill the process forcebly. To find the os processes we use the -e flag along with the ps command.


    ps aux
    top
    htop
    pstree
    ps axjf

    ps -e -o comm
    pgrep polkitd
    
    lsof -i -n -P
    lsof -i -n -P -p 142
    ss -tuln | grep :80
     
    ps -e
    kill 143
    kill -9 143

### Searching in Linux :

To search recursively in folder or directory we can use grep to match the patter. We can also use ag to match expressions if silver-searcher is installed in the system for more efficiency.
We can also use the find command and provide it with some parameters to get the recursive search done.
  
    grep -r 'i' /mnt/d/myfolder
    ag 'i' /mnt/d/myfolder
    find /mnt/d/myfolder -type f -exec grep -l 'i' {} \;

### Head and Tail :

Head is used to show the beginning part of the file. It has -n flag which is used to specify the number of lines we want to show instead of showing the whole file.
Similarly,tail is used to show the end part of the file. It has the -n flag which is also used to tell how many number of lines to display from the end. Apart from this it has -f flag which is used to continuously display the new line added to the file this is mostly used in case of monitoring the log files.

    head mytext.txt
    head -n 15 mytext.txt
    tail mytext.txt
    tail -n 15 mytext.txt
    tail -f /myfolder/myfile
    long-running-command | tail -n 10 -f
